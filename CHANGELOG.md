# Changelog

All notable public GovEngine changes should be documented here.

GovEngine follows conservative pre-1.0 versioning while the API boundary is still being extracted from Ravenclaw.

## Unreleased

- Nothing yet.

## 0.1.4 - API surface registry

- Added a tested public surface registry in `govengine.surfaces` that names the artifact-governance core, controlled-execution core, and optional security-profile helper surface without moving live execution or protocol adapters into GovEngine.
- Clarified that action/tool/scope/policy/signal helpers are an optional security profile for hosts such as Ravenclaw, while artifact lifecycle/signing/trust/execution gates remain the neutral core.
- Released the package version for the API surface registry line after the standard release checklist and operator approval.

## 0.1.3 - artifact governance control gates

- Added initial portable artifact-governance boundary objects in `govengine.core`.
- Added SCLite lifecycle status mapping, lifecycle transition gates, signing/trust bridge helpers, dry-run-only controlled execution gates, deconfliction/change-order helpers, and lightweight artifact state-index summaries.
- Updated public roadmap/API/status docs to keep carrier adapters deferred and document that live execution remains disabled by default.
- Released the package version for the artifact-governance control-gate line after the standard release checklist and operator approval.

## 0.1.2 - contract extraction

- Extracted reusable signal, analysis, and confirmation-evidence policy contracts from Ravenclaw into `govengine.contracts.*`.
- Added standalone tests for signal promotion bridges, governance-blocked evidence classification, analysis success semantics, and confirmed-evidence gates.
- Prepared the package version for the signal/evidence/analysis contract extraction line. Publication requires the standard release checklist and operator approval.

## 0.1.1 - metadata calibration

- Updated the PyPI package description to describe GovEngine as carrier-agnostic governed execution services that consume SCLite contract lifecycle artifacts for policy-gated security automation.
- Calibrated validation, roadmap, publishing, and public-status docs after `govengine==0.1.0` PyPI publication.

## 0.1.0 - initial PyPI candidate

- Switched SCLite dependency from a Git URL pin to the published PyPI distribution `sclite-core>=0.2.1,<0.3`.
- Normalized package license metadata to SPDX-style `MIT`.
- Added `govengine.__version__` for package/version checks.
- Added OODA receipt/evidence guidance for recording compact governance-control decisions without publishing raw output or private telemetry.
- Added deterministic OODA safety/control primitives: `GovObservation`, `GovOrientation`, `GovOodaDecision`, and `GovOodaController`.
- Added carrier-neutral runner protocol primitives: `GovRunnerStep`, `GovRunnerRequest`, `GovRunnerStepResult`, `GovRunnerReceipt`, and `GovRunner`.
- Added public API envelopes: `GovApiResult` and `GovApiError`.
- Kept SCLite imports lazy where needed so GovEngine public surface imports cleanly in standalone checks.
- Documented that carrier adapters remain deferred until the package/release boundary is more mature.

## 0.0.0

- Initial public extraction scaffold.
- Added importable `govengine` package, standalone tests, GitHub Actions pytest workflow, and initial architecture/API-boundary documentation.
- Added reusable helpers extracted around action validation, policy gateway behavior, approved execution specs, execution-ticket checks, command-shape normalization, dry-run result assembly, scope helpers, and SCLite lifecycle integration seams.
